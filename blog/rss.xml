            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Solus Development Log.</p>
<p>The Solus Development Log will be used by Solus Staff and outside contributors to hightlight wins and changes in Solus. Keep an eye on this space.</p>
<p>The Solus DevLog has been setup to facilitate improved communication with the outside world; wins, signficant changes, as well as challenges, within Solus. Solus Staff and contributors are encouraged to use this space.</p>
<p>The DevLog has been setup as a seperate entity to the <a href="https://getsol.us/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solus Blog</a> to encourage more short form development content that doesn't require the same level of polish as an official blog post.</p>
<p>It is hoped that this will be used to help communicate what's going on in Solus such that our short-term and medium-term progress, goals, and ambitions are less of a black box to the outside world.</p>
<p>Additionally, we believe it will help provide context to any of our murmurings for any users who keep an eye on the <a href="https://github.com/getsolus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getsolus</a> GitHub organization page and the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#solus:matrix.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solus</a> Matrix channels.</p>
<p>Hope to see you back at this space soon with more content!</p>]]></content:encoded>
